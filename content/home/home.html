                    <div>I am a technical leader with a proven record of excelling in many roles throughout the software development process. I can zoom out to define strategy and architecture, lead and organize teams, communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders, grow and mentor people, and execute on the details. I love being part of creating products, and I'm really good at it.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>I have extensive full-stack development experience and moderate experience in native mobile applications. My full-stack development has been primarily in C# and Angular. Software development is a field where you cannot excel if you are not a continuous learner - technologies are constantly evolving and emerging. I have built a solid core understanding of development principles that I can apply to whatever tech stack comes next.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>I have been operating in people and practice leadership roles in addition to project leadership and execution. Being a people leader has been an incredibly fulfilling part of my career - at the end of the day, we are all people, not just hands on keyboards - and I find joy when my team is heard, advocated for, and enabled to grow.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>Product strategy and project leadership have been consistent strengths throughout my career. I cannot resist bringing passion to whatever I'm asked to work on. I care deeply about the work I produce and even more about the outcomes of the products my team delivers. Not only is it about having pride in the things I'm helping to create, but it makes work a lot more fun when you're an active participant in success.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>My approach combines deep technical knowledge with strong people leadership, allowing me to effectively guide teams while maintaining hands-on understanding of development challenges. I'm passionate about creating and delivering products that solve problems while fostering an environment where engineers can do their best work.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="bold">I'm open to discussing engineering leadership opportunities across roles such as Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Senior Developer, Solutions Architect, and technical product leadership positions.</div>
